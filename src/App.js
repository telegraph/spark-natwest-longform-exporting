            n the year to May 2019, British exports hit £647.1bn, with goods exports rising 4.7pc to £357.1bn.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the UK services sector enjoyed a 3.3pc increase in exports, bringing the UK’s trade surplus in services to £107.3bn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr Liam Fox, the outgoing International Trade Secretary, said in July: “Despite the global headwinds getting stronger, today’s record-breaking statistics highlight what a real international trade policy can deliver for the UK.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017, 30pc of Britain’s GDP was generated by exports, prompting the Government to announce an ambitious goal to raise this to 35pc via a campaign to educate, connect and finance small businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite worrying signs from the global economy, UK exporters continue to boom, helped not only by the weak pound but also by Britain’s strength in sectors such as technology, which exported £55bn of goods and services in the 12 months to May this year.

            David Salter, head of funded trade finance at NatWest, says: “Despite the uncertainty caused by Brexit and various inter-country trade wars across the globe, the benefits of tapping into a foreign market with strong demand could be game-changing for businesses.”

              “If the foreign market is big enough, this demand could help you reduce your production costs and increase your profit margin further,” explains Mr Salter.

              Companies that export goods are more resilient when recessions strike, says Stuart Lisle, tax partner at business advisory company BDO. When business slows down in one territory, exporters can find greater opportunities elsewhere, he says. “The more markets a business sells into, the less impacted they are when certain markets aren’t doing as well, making them more economically resilient.”

              Mr Taylor says: “The benefits of exporting are easy to see – a company of any size can increase sales and revenue, enhance competitiveness and overcome domestic market saturation by finding new overseas customers.”

              Making the decision to export delivers benefits very quickly, and they continue over time, says Lesley Batchelor, director-general of the Institute of Export & International Trade.

              Ms Batchelor says: “Exporting is shown to increase the productivity of a business up to 34pc in the first year, and then a continuing benefit of 11pc is shown to strengthen businesses against downturns in economic terms.”

              Businesses need to make sure they know the landscape when it comes to foreign exchange and local regulations, says Ms Batchelor.

              She says: “There can be surprises on foreign exchange if you don’t seek help early – and I mean at the quotation stage. Another issue could be non-tariff barriers such as protectionist measures or hidden regulations. The Government has launched a trade remedies body to help if businesses find anything too difficult to work with.”

              The financial side of exporting can be complicated, so it pays to understand this first, says Mr Taylor. “When it comes to exporting, it isn’t always enough to have a great product or service.

              “Companies can face a number of financial constraints when securing and fulfilling export contracts without the right backing. This can include working capital challenges, bond requirements from their overseas customers or not being able to access credit insurance to sell to a particular market.”

              “Brexit is causing a great deal of uncertainty. It’s not stopping companies from trading, but many are putting contingency plans in place, for instance, in case supply into or out of the UK is disrupted.”

              Mr Salter points out that there are measures that companies can take to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit.

              He says: “The best guidance to give here is to regularly check the Government’s Department for International Trade website and those of organisations such as chambers of commerce and the Institute of Export – as well as any sector-based trade organisations, such as the SMMT [Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders] in the automotive sector, who may have sector-specific advice.”

              It is wise to keep an eye on current affairs more generally, Mr Salter adds, as trade policies can impact exporters. “British exports in many industry sectors are held in high regard and demanded in many foreign markets. There are strong benefits to tapping into a new export market.”

              Exporting can throw up other unexpected challenges, such as theft of intellectual property, says Robert Phillips, senior lecturer in entrepreneurship at Alliance Manchester Business School.

              Dr Philips says: “Specific problems could include language barriers, finding a way to advertise to customers, regulations, unexpected taxes, finding appropriate trusted partners in the host country, exchange rate fluctuations and potential theft of IP [intellectual property] – especially patent and trademark – in countries that don’t follow WIPO [World Intellectual Property Organization] rules.”

              He adds that currency fluctuations can also pose a threat to companies with low profit margins. “Often companies begin to export when exchange rates are favourable and the picture looks very profitable, but of course it can fluctuate.”

              In a post-Brexit world, research and planning should help British to stay on the right track, says Ms Batchelor.

              “Businesses that already trade with markets outside the EU are used to the trading regimes and paperwork needed to succeed. British exporters must find out what their responsibilities are, what they need to register for, any compliance issues they have with the market they are working with and how to get paid.

              “All these issues are covered by investing in training in these matters and also research and planning. Exporting is not a one-off but a planned approach to growing a business – and unfortunately, making a quick buck doesn’t bring sustainable growth.”

              The EU remains Britain’s largest trading partner, but the proportion of Britain’s exports going to the EU has slowly dropped, from 55pc in 2006 to 46pc in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.

              Several trends underlie this, including some EU countries’ poor recovery from the financial crisis. Britain’s exports briefly dropped from 30.5pc of GDP in 2011 to 27.2pc in 2015, driven in part by a post-recession weakness in exports to the EU.
