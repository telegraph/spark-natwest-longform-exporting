He says: “In all other industries, technology makes things more affordable, so we wanted to do that.<br />“I’ve always been tracking cutting-edge technologies and I saw the costs of 3D printing and computer-aided design [CAD] systems were becoming more accessible. So we started researching and seeing if there could be a way to internally manufacture the most desirable teeth-straightening solution – invisible aligners using 3D printing for a price that would mean we could offer it for a third of the price of in-clinic options.<br />“We realised we could, so we sold our clinic and Straight Teeth Direct was born.”',

Mr Thuiller says his competitors actually energised sales.<br />“When we first launched Oppo we were the first healthy ice cream globally. Five years later there are 35 companies. This space has become massively congested.<br />“It\'s very important to welcome competitors, using their might to support their company. Within six months of Unilever coming into the space, they educated consumers about healthy ice cream, and our sales doubled. We always focus on innovation.”',

The resulting collaboration helps businesses to “develop technologies which solve problems, increase productivity, boost the UK economy and open up new markets faster”.<br />He adds: “Digital Catapult provides physical and digital facilities for experimentation, testing and development that would otherwise not be accessible for smaller companies.<br />“In January, we launched the Future Networks Lab in partnership with Siemens, BT and a number of other big industry players. It’s one of the first facilities in Europe specifically designed to enable UK start-ups, corporations and network platform providers to collaborate on solutions using 5G and IoT technologies.”<br />Such facilities can supercharge the process by which businesses reach out to support networks, suppliers and other businesses in order to collaborate and grow.',
